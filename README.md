Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the caesar cipher algorithm allow the user to input a message amd shift value to perform encryption and decryption .

How It Works !
Encrypting: For each letter, the program shifts it forward by the specified amount (wraps around from 'Z' to 'A' for uppercase and 'z' to 'a' for lowercase).
Decrypting: The shift is applied in reverse by negating it.
Input Handling: Non-alphabetic characters remain the same, making it safe for sentences with punctuation and spaces.
